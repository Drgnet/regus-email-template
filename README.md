Hello! This is an HTML template for use with the Black Friday deal going on. In order for
you to add it to your email I would recommend you look online on how to add an HTML email
to the email client that you use. It is worth noting that the orginal template was written
for the ASM Dustin, and you should change the name to yours, and the email to yours as
well. you can find the emails listed on lines 147, and 213. The name on the body of the
email can be changed like normal on from the body of the email. If you have any additional
questions about this template, feel free to reach out to me, or your supervisor to get in
contact with me.
